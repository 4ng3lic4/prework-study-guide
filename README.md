## Description
Prework Study Guide is a website for new developers. They can refer to at the beginning of their carrers to learn about coding language. This information will help them through the coding process. 

The creation of this website has the purpose of helping people interested in starting to code. This is an easy way to access valuable information that can otherwise be overwhelming in more advanced documentation sources. In this website the information is easily organized by sections and the user can explore the section they are interested in. This website facilitates basic information that can be further complemented once the user become familiar with coding languages.

While working on this project, I learned how to save my work on Git and GitHub besides the traditional option of working on a text editor to code a website.
